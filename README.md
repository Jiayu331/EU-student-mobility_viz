# EU-student-mobility_viz
TidyTuesday 20220308 Erasmus student mobility data wrangling and visualization practice

The population data that I used to visualize point plot is saved as "eu_population.csv".

In the final visualization, the two plots were generated with R code but further edited in adobe illustrator.
Items edited in illustrator:
- added the plot title, subtitle and descriptions;
- edited the font and size of axis labels, x and y labels, country names on the plot;
- changed a few country colors in point plot.
